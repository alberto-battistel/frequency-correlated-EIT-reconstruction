[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/784914338.svg)](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10959765)

This repository was made for the conference paper __Multifrequency image reconstruction for electrical impedance tomography__
submitted to the [BMT 2024 conference in Stuttgart](https://www.vde.com/bmt).


## What you need to run this code

- Matlab (it was tested with Matlab R2023b on a linux machine)
- [EIDORS 3.11 with Netgen 5.3](https://eidors3d.sourceforge.net/)
- A matlab function called `init_eidors.mat` available to your path containing
`run /path/to/eidors3d/startup.m` see [EIDORS first tutorial](https://eidors3d.sourceforge.net/tutorial/EIDORS_basics/one_line.shtml)


## How to use this repository

By running `all_analysis_and_plot.m` you will get figure 1, 2, and 3 of the conference paper
plus additional plots.
Please note that the figures you will get need formatting to appear exactly as those of the conference paper.
